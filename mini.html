          <h2>Mini</h2>
          <strong><p>Sex: Female</p>
          <p>D.O.B: July 2007</p></strong>
          <p><br> Mini is a 13-year-old tricolor cat. She's my absolute favorite.
            She came to my life unexpectedly, when our family was having dinner at a restaurant near our house.
            My dad heard a tiny "meow" when we left the place, but we couldn't find anything. After we got home,
            it started to rain. I couldn't sleep and ask my mom if we should give another try. I'm so thankful with that decision.
            We went back and saw a tiny little kitten crawling to the middle of the street under the pouring rain. As if she tried to come to us!
